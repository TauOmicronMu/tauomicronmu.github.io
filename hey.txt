  Hey! I'm Tom! 
I'm a senior software engineering consultant at CGI (formerly BJSS). I'm also one of the organisers of 
TechMids, the founder of HackTheMidlands, and a huge fan of the Birmingham tech community! :) 
  I'm also a keen musician (pianist & singer), and really enjoy both performing and composing in my spare time. 
  I've spent far too long already on this site, and I keep getting nerd sniped by people who are suggesting 
cool things to implement... like vim... and vim... ...
  If you're reading this - say hey! Chuck me a message on Twitter - I'm @TauOmicronMu, or LinkedIn (tagoodman)!
