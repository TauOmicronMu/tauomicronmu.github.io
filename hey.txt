  Hey! I'm Tom! 
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Warwick, working on mathematical modelling for the ARME project, 
  and on markerless motion tracking. I'm also the founder of HackTheMidlands, and a huge fan of the Birmingham
  tech community! :) 
  Now we've gotten that out of the way (I know it was a bit of a mouthful...)
  I'm also a keen musician (pianist & singer), and really enjoy both performing and composing in my spare time. 
  I've spent far too long already on this site, and I keep getting nerd sniped by people who are suggesting 
cool things to implement... like vim... and vim... ...
  If you're reading this - say hey! Chuck me a message on Twitter - I'm @TauOmicronMu!
